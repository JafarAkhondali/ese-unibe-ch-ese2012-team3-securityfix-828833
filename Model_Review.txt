Code Review for Model

Design: There could be some more invariants, especially in organization.rb.
The distribution of responsibilities between the classes seams quiet clean and there
is also a good reuse of code through inheritance (agents). There are however always
the same class methods, that keep repeating. But I can think of no better solution.

Coding style: Talking about class methods, what I find slightly irritating is that
sometimes you start your id counter by 0 and other times by 1. I find it most confusing
in user.rb where the counter is initially 0 and after .delete_all it is reset to 0.
Naming of methods are in a way that help understand the code. There is however the issue,
where within the method you use 'user' when you actually mean 'agent' or 'organisation',
as far as I understand it (see organisation.rb).

Documentation: The class documentation is very scarce to almost non existing. Although
the documentation for methods are provided, it'd be very nice, if there was a description
for each class, explaining its main responsibilities and its usage.
