Code Review for the Views

Design aspects: It is good that the requested URLs and the name of the views
correspond, this makes it easier to search for a specific piece of code. Most
names of the views are quite self-explanatory (some exceptions: setting.erb should
be user_settings.erb and layout.erb seems to send messages to the user and sets up
the main layout). What is not so beautiful is that those messages in layout.rb
are hard coded. I would suggest a more flexible solution. You could do this via
session:

Create an Alert class:

class Alert {
  attr_accessor :title, :message

  def self.create(title, message)
    alert = Alter.new
    alert.title = title
    alert.message = message

    alert
  end
}

Pass it like this:

if ( your_condition)
    session[:alert] = Alert.create("Title", "Message")
    redirect "/?alert"
end

Then check if an alert is set in layout.rb

<% if ! session[:alert].nil?%>
<div class="alert-error alert" id="alert"><strong><%= "#{session[:alert].title}" %></strong><br />
<%= "#{session[:alert].message}" %></div>

<% session[:alert] = nil
 end %>

With that solution you probably could leave as well that fancy java-script stuff
to hide all those hard coded messages and you wouldn't even need the "?alert" part.

There are 16 views with the prefix "_", which seem to be reused in various other parts
so the code reuse is quite big. Because of the great amount of views I would suggest
to make subfolders, but its also ok the way it is.

Coding style: The views are quite consistent. The names of the variables are most
of the time well chosen. At the beginning of most views is a check if the parameters
are null, if they are they get a default value assigned, if not they keep their
assigned value. This is done with a conditional operator. Generally some more empty
lines would be good because now sometimes the code is hard to read.

Documentation: It would really help if there was a short description of what a view
should show. Some of the parts could be understood easier if you add some really
short comments above a bit of code that performs a functionally more or less independent
part within the file. The description of the necessary parameters of a view are very helpfull
but why was sometimes "*" and sometimes ":" used to list the parameters? I assume * is required
and : is optional, but I am not sure since in _agent_list.rb version seems to be a parameter
that is both. Perhaps a explanation of these symbols is needed in the readme.
