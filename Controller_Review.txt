Code Review for the Controllers:

Design aspects: There are from time to time code parts which handle business
processes, meaning that they should belong to the model not to the controller
according to the MVC model. The responsibilities are clear and can be mostly
guessed from the name of the controller.

Coding style: The controllers are in general consistent except the part of the
error handling which is managed in two different ways in the controllers. The
names of the variables are straightforward as well as the names of the views
which are needed for the post/get statements so the intention of the code parts
can be easily derived. Possible exceptions are being handled and nil values are
taken into account. The handling always consists of a feedback to the user of the
application so that the action can be redone. Preconditions are not always being
checked for, thus there is the possibility that an error can occur which could
have been easily avoided.

Documentation: Well, there isn't a lot of documentation in the controllers
although it is sometimes desirable. The given documentation reveals the inten-
tions of the following code part quite well. The responsibilities are rarely
stated, especially the responsibility of the controller itself.
